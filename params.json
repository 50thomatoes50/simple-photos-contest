Vote for your favorites photos.\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n------------\r\n\r\n+ PHP 5.3\r\n+ MySQL 5.5\r\n+ Gettext enabled (for translations)\r\n+ GD Image Library\r\n\r\nThere is nothing unusual, as GD and gettext are enabled on most of web hosting platforms. Simple Photos Contest may work with previous versions of PHP and MySQL, but it hasn't been tested.\r\n\r\nRuns well on IE 8+, FF, Opera, Chrome (and probably Safari, but it hasn't been tested). Javascript is required.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\n+ Make the cache dir writable (777).\r\n+ import install.sql in your mysql db.\r\n+ Rename config-sample.php into config.php.\r\n+ Edit config.php to change db connect values and admin password.\r\n+ Configure SPC in admin panel.\r\n\r\nQuick Start\r\n-----------\r\n\r\n+ Create directory in your photos dir.\r\n+ Put your photos into this dir.\r\n+ Activate it in admin panel.\r\n+ The first load of a contest page is slow. No panic, it's because TimThumb needs to create thumbnails of all the gallery photos. The next load will be a lot faster !\r\n\r\nFAQ\r\n---\r\n\r\n<dl>\r\n\t<dt>Where is the admin panel ?</dt>\r\n\t<dd>There is small icon in upper right corner of the main page. Just click on it, enter password and you will get the admin panel.</dd>\r\n\t<dt>How can I translate Simple Photos contest ?</dt>\r\n\t<dd>There is a pot template file in lang dir. Edit it with a po editor like [PoEdit](http://www.poedit.net) in Windows, then mimic the french translation files tree.</dd>\r\n</dl>\r\n\r\nTO-DO\r\n-----\r\n\r\n+ Display stats in frontend (with setting to disable it)\r\n\r\nComponents used\r\n---------------\r\n\r\n+ [TimThumb](http://www.binarymoon.co.uk/projects/timthumb/) 2.8.11\r\n+ [jQuery](http://jquery.com) 1.8.2\r\n+ [Freetile](https://github.com/yconst/Freetile) (customized)\r\n+ [SlimBox 2.04](http://www.digitalia.be/software/slimbox2) (customized)\r\n+ [Zebra DatePicker](http://stefangabos.ro/jquery/zebra-datepicker/) 1.6.2\r\n+ [jqBarGraph](http://workshop.rs/jqbargraph/) 1.1\r\n+ [Tiny Scrollbar](http://baijs.nl/tinyscrollbar/) 1.81\r\n\r\nBug tracker\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nHave a bug?
